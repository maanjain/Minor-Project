# ✨ Characterization of 2D-SnS Nano-Material

**Excited to share our B.Tech Minor Project, where we successfully fabricated and characterized 2D Tin Sulfide ($\text{SnS}$) nano-materials for potential optoelectronic applications!**

---

## 💡 Project Overview

We are pleased to present our team's **B.Tech Minor Project**, conducted alongside **Omkar Nishad** & **Priyanshu Soni**. Our focus was on the **low-cost synthesis** and **structural/optical characterization** of **2D Tin Sulfide ($\text{SnS}$) nano-materials**—a promising material for high-sensitivity photodetectors.

This project involved the systematic **fabrication** of the $\text{SnS}$ active material on **Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) glass**. Our work emphasized material preparation and comprehensive analysis of its fundamental properties.

### 🔬 Key Fabrication and Characterization Techniques

We employed the following techniques to confirm the successful synthesis and analyze the fundamental properties of the $\text{SnS}$ nano-material:

* 🔹 **Scanning Electron Microscopy Analysis (SEM):** Investigating the surface **morphology** and microstructure of the $\text{SnS}$ film.

* 🔹 **Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX):** Analyzing the **elemental composition** and purity of the fabricated film.
* 🔹 **UV-visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis):** Studying the material's fundamental **optical absorption** characteristics and determining the band gap.
* 🔹 **X-ray Diffraction analysis (XRD):** Confirming the **crystal structure** and **phase purity** of the synthesized $\text{SnS}$ nano-material. 
* 🔹 **Material Synthesis Protocol:** Detailed documentation of the low-cost fabrication steps used.
